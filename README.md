### Organized Categories
- **Profile Red Flags**: Appearance, digital footprint, location inconsistencies
- **Conversation Red Flags**: Communication patterns, emotional manipulation, inconsistencies
- **Financial Red Flags**: Requests for money, gifts, or financial information

### Interactive Features
